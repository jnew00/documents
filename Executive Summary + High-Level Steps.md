### **Executive Summary \+ High-Level Steps**

This playbook provides a repeatable, human-centered methodology for continuously improving the internal developer experience. It treats the internal platform as a product and engineers as customers, focusing on removing waste and friction from their daily work.

The methodology is an iterative cycle built on Lean and Design Thinking principles, with the **Jobs to be Done (JTBD)** framework at its core to maintain a laser focus on user outcomes. Instead of just asking what users want, we seek to understand the "job" they are trying to accomplish.

#### **The Continuous Improvement Cycle: A 4-Phase Methodology**

**1\. Phase 1: Frame & Empathize**

* **Goal:** Understand the core "job" a developer is trying to get done, including the functional, social, and emotional drivers behind their work.  
* **High-Level Steps:**  
  * **Frame the Problem:** Use "How Might We...?" questions to turn challenges into opportunities.\[1\]  
  * **Conduct Contextual Inquiry:** Observe developers in their natural environment ("Gemba") to see their real-world workflows and workarounds.\[2, 3\]  
  * **Perform JTBD Interviews:** Ask targeted questions about recent experiences to uncover the underlying progress a developer is trying to make.  
  * **Gather Artifacts:** Collect scripts, runbooks, and wikis that developers use to get their jobs done today.

**2\. Phase 2: Map & Diagnose**

* **Goal:** Make invisible friction visible to the organization and pinpoint the systemic root causes of waste and delay.  
* **High-Level Steps:**  
  * **Create Internal Customer Journey Maps:** Visualize the end-to-end steps, tools, and emotional state of a developer as they perform a specific job.\[4\]  
  * **Develop Service Blueprints:** Connect the developer's journey (frontstage) to the hidden internal processes and team handoffs (backstage) that enable or block it.\[5, 6\]  
  * **Analyze through JTBD Lens:** For each step in the journey, ask: "Does this action help the user make progress on their job, or is it organizational waste?".\[7\]  
  * **Perform Root Cause Analysis:** Use the "5 Whys" technique to trace symptoms back to their systemic source.\[7\]

**3\. Phase 3: Ideate & Co-Create**

* **Goal:** Collaboratively design a better future state with users, guided by a clear understanding of the "job" they need to accomplish.  
* **High-Level Steps:**  
  * **Run Future-State Journey Mapping Workshops:** Bring developers and stakeholders together to redesign the ideal workflow.\[8, 1\]  
  * **Design "Golden Paths":** Define opinionated, automated, and supported workflows that provide the best way to get a specific job done securely and efficiently.\[9, 10, 11\]  
  * **Prototype and Test Concepts:** Create low-fidelity mockups or process diagrams to get early feedback on new ideas before committing engineering resources.\[1, 12\]

**4\. Phase 4: Experiment & Embed**

* **Goal:** Deliver value incrementally, measure the impact of changes, and create a continuous learning loop.  
* **High-Level Steps:**  
  * **Formulate a Hypothesis:** Frame every improvement as a testable experiment (e.g., "We believe this change will reduce deployment time by X%").\[8, 13\]  
  * **Build an MVP:** Implement the smallest possible change to test the hypothesis with a pilot group.\[14\]  
  * **Measure the Impact:** Use a dashboard of developer experience metrics (DORA, Flow Efficiency, Developer NPS) to validate the experiment's success.\[15, 16, 17\]  
  * **Standardize and Embed:** Roll out successful changes broadly, update documentation, and make the improvement the new standard way of working.\[13\]
