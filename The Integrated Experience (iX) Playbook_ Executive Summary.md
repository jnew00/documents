### **The Integrated Experience (iX) Playbook: Executive Summary \+ High-Level Steps**

This playbook provides a repeatable, human-centered methodology for the Integrated Experience (iX) team to continuously improve the end-to-end journeys for engineers, architects, and compliance partners who consume the firm's ecosystem of internal infrastructure products.

Our environment is not a single platform but a collection of interconnected products. Therefore, this methodology focuses on the **integrated experience** of using these products together. It treats this collection as a holistic product portfolio, with the goal of removing friction and waste from complex, cross-product journeys.

The methodology is an iterative cycle built on Lean and Design Thinking principles. It is powered by the **Jobs to be Done (JTBD)** framework to focus on user outcomes and measured by the **Fit for Purpose (F4P)** framework to ensure our products are truly helping users achieve their goals.

#### **The Continuous Improvement Cycle: A 4-Phase Methodology**

**1\. Phase 1: Frame & Empathize**

* **Goal:** Understand the core "job" a user is trying to accomplish across the product ecosystem, including their functional, social, and emotional drivers.  
* **High-Level Steps:**  
  * **Frame the Problem:** Use "How Might We...?" questions to turn cross-product challenges into opportunities.  
  * **Conduct Contextual Inquiry:** Observe users in their natural environment ("Gemba") to see how they navigate between different products and teams to get work done.  
  * **Perform JTBD & Fit for Purpose (F4P) Interviews:** Use structured F4P surveys and JTBD interviews to systematically capture the specific "jobs" (e.g., "migrate a legacy service") and measure how well the current ecosystem supports that purpose.\[1\]  
  * **Gather Artifacts:** Collect scripts, runbooks, and wikis that show how users currently bridge the gaps between different internal products.

**2\. Phase 2: Map & Diagnose**

* **Goal:** Make the invisible friction of cross-product journeys visible to the organization and pinpoint the systemic root causes of waste and delay.  
* **High-Level Steps:**  
  * **Create Integrated Journey Maps:** Visualize the end-to-end steps, tools, and emotional state of a user as they interact with multiple products and teams to complete a job.  
  * **Develop Service Blueprints:** Connect the user's journey (frontstage) to the hidden internal processes, handoffs between product teams, and governance steps (backstage) that cause friction.\[2, 3\]  
  * **Analyze through JTBD Lens:** For each step in the journey, ask: "Does this action help the user make progress on their job, or is it organizational waste caused by product seams?".\[4\]  
  * **Perform Root Cause Analysis:** Use the "5 Whys" technique to trace symptoms (e.g., slow migration) back to their systemic source (e.g., incompatible artifact formats between two platform products).\[4\]

**3\. Phase 3: Ideate & Co-Create**

* **Goal:** Collaboratively design seamless, integrated future-state journeys with users and the various product teams.  
* **High-Level Steps:**  
  * **Run Future-State Journey Mapping Workshops:** Bring users and stakeholders from different product teams together to redesign the ideal, frictionless workflow.  
  * **Design "Golden Journeys":** Define opinionated, automated, and supported workflows that span multiple products to provide the best way to get a specific job done securely and efficiently.\[5, 6, 7\]  
  * **Prototype and Test Concepts:** Create low-fidelity mockups of new integrated UIs or process diagrams to get early feedback before committing engineering resources across multiple teams.

**4\. Phase 4: Experiment & Embed**

* **Goal:** Deliver value incrementally, measure the impact of changes on the integrated experience, and create a continuous learning loop.  
* **High-Level Steps:**  
  * **Formulate a Hypothesis:** Frame every improvement as a testable experiment (e.g., "We believe this new migration toolkit will improve the Fit for Purpose score for the 'migrate a legacy service' job").\[8, 9\]  
  * **Build an MVP:** Implement the smallest possible change across the necessary products to test the hypothesis with a pilot group.  
  * **Measure the Impact:** Use a dashboard of metrics, centered on the **Fit for Purpose Fitness Box Score**, to validate the experiment's success against the specific user purpose.\[1\]  
  * **Standardize and Embed:** Roll out successful changes broadly, update documentation for the integrated journey, and make the improvement the new standard way of working.
