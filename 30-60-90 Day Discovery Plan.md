### **30-60-90 Day Discovery Plan**

Here is an actionable plan for the Integrated Experience (iX) team to kickstart discovery efforts and build momentum, designed to work even without pre-existing quantitative data.

**First 30 Days: Listen, Learn, and Align**

* **Goal:** Understand the current landscape, map the product ecosystem, build relationships, and identify a high-value pilot journey using qualitative signals.  
* **Activities:**  
  * **Stakeholder Listening Tour:** Schedule 1:1 meetings with leaders and product managers from the various Infrastructure Platform (IP) product teams, as well as key consumers in Application Development, Architecture, Risk, and Compliance. Ask: "What is the most frustrating process for your teams right now?".\[10, 11\]  
  * **Map the Product Ecosystem:** Create a high-level map of the internal products, identifying their owners, primary functions, and key integration points. This is crucial for understanding the "system" you are trying to improve.  
  * **Perform "Process Archeology":** Manually review support ticket backlogs, incident post-mortems, and internal chat channels. Look for recurring themes of frustration, especially those that mention multiple tools or teams.  
  * **Deploy Initial Fit for Purpose (F4P) Survey:** Launch a broad F4P survey to a wide group of engineers. The goal is to discover the most common "Jobs to be Done" and get an initial data-driven reading on which ones are causing the most pain.\[1\]  
  * **Select a Pilot "Job" or Journey:** Based on the combined signals from the above activities, use the Prioritization Matrix (User Pain vs. Business Impact) to select the first journey to analyze.

**Days 31-60: Execute Pilot & Generate Your First Hard Data**

* **Goal:** Demonstrate the value of the iX methodology by executing the first two phases and delivering tangible insights, including your first manually-calculated metrics.  
* **Activities:**  
  * **Conduct Pilot Research:** Perform contextual inquiries (shadowing) and in-depth JTBD interviews with engineers from your partner team as they perform the pilot "job".\[12\] Pay close attention to the handoffs between different products, tools, and teams.  
  * **Facilitate an Integrated Journey Mapping Workshop:** Work directly with the pilot team to create the first draft of the current-state journey map. Visualize every tool they touch and every team they have to contact.\[10\]  
  * **Manually Calculate Baseline Metrics:** As you map the journey, ask about durations. "How long did you wait for that approval?" "How long did that pipeline run?" Use this information to calculate your first approximate **Flow Time** and **Flow Efficiency**. This is your baseline.  
  * **Synthesize Initial Findings:** Analyze the map to identify the top 3-5 friction points, specifically highlighting those that occur at the "seams" between different internal products.

**Days 61-90: Socialize, Strategize, and Scale**

* **Goal:** Solidify the pilot findings, create a vision for a seamless future-state journey, and establish a repeatable process for the next cycle.  
* **Activities:**  
  * **Finalize Pilot Artifacts:** Refine the journey map and create a corresponding **service blueprint**. This blueprint is critical for showing leadership how handoffs and misalignments between internal product teams are impacting the end-user experience.\[10\]  
  * **Host an Ideation Workshop:** Facilitate a session with the pilot team and the relevant IP product managers to co-create a future-state "Golden Journey" that feels like a single, cohesive experience.  
  * **Present the Pilot Story:** Share the compelling narrative of your pilot—the current state pain (backed by your new, manually-generated metrics), the systemic root causes, and the vision for the future—with the broader leadership group to secure buy-in for implementation.  
  * **Establish Repeatable Processes:** Create standardized templates for your interview guides, integrated journey maps, and service blueprints. Document your process so it can be easily repeated for the next journey.\[10\]  
  * **Prioritize Next Journeys:** Based on the success of the pilot, begin the "Step 0: Finding the Friction" process again to select the next high-priority journey to improve.
