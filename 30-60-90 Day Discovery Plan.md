### **30-60-90 Day Discovery Plan**

Here is an actionable plan for the Integrated Experience (iX) team to kickstart discovery efforts and build momentum.

**First 30 Days: Listen, Learn, and Align**

* **Goal:** Understand the current landscape, map the product ecosystem, build relationships, and identify a high-value pilot journey.  
* **Activities:**  
  * **Stakeholder Listening Tour:** Schedule 1:1 meetings with leaders and product managers from the various Infrastructure Platform (IP) product teams, as well as key consumers in Application Development, Architecture, Risk, and Compliance.\[10, 11\]  
  * **Map the Product Ecosystem:** Create a high-level map of the internal products, identifying their owners, primary functions, and key integration points. This is crucial for understanding the "system" you are trying to improve.  
  * **Review Existing Data:** Collect and analyze any existing documentation, post-mortems, support ticket data, or developer surveys that hint at cross-product friction.  
  * **Select a Pilot "Job" or Journey:** Based on your initial conversations, identify one high-impact, chronic pain point that requires users to interact with multiple products (e.g., "Onboarding a new team to the full platform stack," "Migrating a legacy service from Platform A to Platform B"). Choose a journey where you have engaged partner teams on both the consumer and provider sides.\[10\]

**Days 31-60: Execute Pilot & Generate Initial Insights**

* **Goal:** Demonstrate the value of the iX methodology by executing the first two phases and delivering tangible insights about cross-product friction.  
* **Activities:**  
  * **Conduct Pilot Research:** Perform contextual inquiries (shadowing) and JTBD/Fit for Purpose interviews with engineers from your partner team as they perform the pilot "job".\[12\] Pay close attention to the handoffs between different products, tools, and teams.  
  * **Facilitate an Integrated Journey Mapping Workshop:** Work directly with the pilot team to create the first draft of the current-state journey map. Visualize every tool they touch and every team they have to contact.\[10\]  
  * **Synthesize Initial Findings:** Analyze the map to identify the top 3-5 friction points, specifically highlighting those that occur at the "seams" between different internal products.  
  * **Share Back Early:** Present these initial findings to the pilot team and the relevant IP product managers. This builds trust and creates a shared understanding of the integrated problem.

**Days 61-90: Socialize, Strategize, and Scale**

* **Goal:** Solidify the pilot findings, create a vision for a seamless future-state journey, and establish a repeatable process for the next cycle.  
* **Activities:**  
  * **Finalize Pilot Artifacts:** Refine the journey map and create a corresponding **service blueprint**. This blueprint is critical for showing leadership how handoffs and misalignments between internal product teams are impacting the end-user experience.\[10\]  
  * **Host an Ideation Workshop:** Facilitate a session with the pilot team and the relevant IP product managers to co-create a future-state "Golden Journey" that feels like a single, cohesive experience.  
  * **Present the Pilot Story:** Share the compelling narrative of your pilot—the current state pain, the systemic root causes, and the vision for the future—with the broader leadership group to secure buy-in for resourcing the necessary changes across the product teams.  
  * **Establish Repeatable Processes:** Create standardized templates for your interview guides, integrated journey maps, and service blueprints. Document your process so it can be easily repeated for the next journey.\[10\]  
  * **Prioritize Next Journeys:** Work with leadership to select the next 1-2 high-priority "jobs" to investigate, turning the one-time pilot into a continuous improvement engine for the entire integrated platform ecosystem.
