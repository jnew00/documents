### **30-60-90 Day Discovery Plan**

Here is an actionable plan to kickstart your discovery efforts and build momentum.

**First 30 Days: Listen, Learn, and Align**

* **Goal:** Understand the current landscape, build relationships, and identify a high-value pilot project.  
* **Activities:**  
  * **Stakeholder Listening Tour:** Schedule 1:1 meetings with leaders in Platform Engineering, Application Development, Architecture, Risk, and Compliance to understand their goals, priorities, and perceptions of the current developer experience.\[18, 19\]  
  * **Identify Advocates & Skeptics:** Note who is enthusiastic about this work and who may need more convincing.  
  * **Review Existing Data:** Collect and analyze any existing documentation, post-mortems, support ticket data, or developer survey results.  
  * **Select a Pilot "Job":** Based on your initial conversations, identify one high-impact, chronic pain point to focus on for the first cycle (e.g., "Onboarding a new microservice," "Debugging a production failure"). Choose a "job" where you have an engaged partner team willing to collaborate.\[18\]

**Days 31-60: Execute Pilot & Generate Initial Insights**

* **Goal:** Demonstrate the value of the methodology by executing the first two phases and delivering tangible insights.  
* **Activities:**  
  * **Conduct Pilot Research:** Perform contextual inquiries (shadowing) and JTBD-style interviews with engineers from your partner team as they perform the pilot "job".\[20\]  
  * **Facilitate a Journey Mapping Workshop:** Work directly with the pilot team to create the first draft of the current-state journey map, capturing their actions, tools, and emotional highs and lows.\[18\]  
  * **Synthesize Initial Findings:** Analyze the map to identify the top 3-5 friction points and their likely root causes.  
  * **Share Back Early:** Present these initial findings back to the pilot team and their leadership. This builds trust, validates your understanding, and shows immediate progress.

**Days 61-90: Socialize, Strategize, and Scale**

* **Goal:** Solidify the pilot findings, create a vision for the future state, and establish a repeatable process for the next cycle.  
* **Activities:**  
  * **Finalize Pilot Artifacts:** Refine the journey map and create a corresponding service blueprint to clearly show the backstage dependencies causing the friction.\[18\]  
  * **Host an Ideation Workshop:** Facilitate a session with the pilot team and key stakeholders to co-create a future-state journey map that solves the identified pain points.  
  * **Present the Pilot Story:** Share the compelling narrative of your pilot—the current state pain, the root causes, and the vision for the future—with the broader leadership group to secure buy-in for implementation.  
  * **Establish Repeatable Processes:** Create standardized templates for your interview guides, journey maps, and service blueprints. Document your process so it can be easily repeated.\[18\]  
  * **Prioritize Next Journeys:** Work with leadership to select the next 1-2 high-priority "jobs" to investigate, turning the one-time pilot into a continuous improvement cycle.
