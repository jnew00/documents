    Comparing conversational AI based support experiences with traditional form and workflow based self service portals.

20. **AI that drafts status updates in minutes vs managers who craft status decks slide by slide**  
    Weighing automated, data driven reporting from AI against human authored narrative updates and presentations.

21. **Bots that review pull requests with perfect memory vs humans who review PRs with lived experience**  
    Comparing automated and AI based code review tools with human reviewers who bring context, mentorship, and judgement.

22. **One legendary enterprise spreadsheet that runs everything vs a grown up data platform that was built to behave**  
    Debating central reliance on a complex spreadsheet versus investing in a governed, scalable enterprise data platform.

23. **Infrastructure as code that lives in git vs point and click configs that live in consoles**  
    Comparing scriptable, version controlled infrastructure management with interactive configuration through graphical tools.

24. **Incident runbooks written calmly on a Tuesday vs runbooks assembled live by AI during a 2 a.m. page**  
    Weighing predefined human authored incident procedures against dynamically generated AI guidance during real time events.

25. **AI generated documentation that never gets tired vs human documentation that understands the story**  
    Comparing automated documentation produced at scale by AI with human authored docs that capture context, nuance, and narrative.

26. **Synthetic test data that looks real but is not vs hand crafted test data with familiar fake people**
